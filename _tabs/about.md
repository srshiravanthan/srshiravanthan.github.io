Hi! I am a **student** studying computer science specialization in cyber security, I am passionate about Cybersecurity and Computer Networks. I have been practicing my skill on **tryhackme, HackTheBox** platform for more than 5 month on a regular basis and I have been participating in CTFs as well.

The aim of this blog is to showcase my abilities and a method for me to monitor my progress as I traverse through the CTF style machines. And try to provide detailed write ups so that if anyone else is stuck somewhere in these machines, these blogs can help them.
