# Lets Start with theoretical Concepts:
In Linux/Unix system there is sudoers file inside the /etc configuration file for sudo rights, we already known the power of sudo command. full form of sudo super user do root privilege tasks, sudoers file is that file where the user and group privilege are stored and run some or all command with root or another user privilege.

If we run a command with sudo (ex: sudo nano), then it will run with root privilege. In Linux/Unix, it checks in the sudoers file whether the user is present inside the file or not; if it’s not present in the sudoers file, then it will not run with root privilege.

In above the image we can see below that user privilege specification root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL,

root user can run on ALL terminal, acting as user ALL: group ALL and run ALL command.

# Sudoer File Syntax:

# Note:

→ (ALL:ALL) can also represent as ALL

→ if you found root inside (ALL:ALL) then it denotes that user can run command with root

→ if nothing is mentioned about user and group then it means use default root user

# Method to Assign Root Privilege:
Lets we create a user and give sudo permission:

example : hacker ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Before that create a user and then assign permission command to create a new user sudo adduser username

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pv33b5jaqCvnN79TTAty-g.png" alt="adding_user">

Enter visudo command to open sudoers file editor where you can edit the sudoers file

```shell
sudo visudo

hacker ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
or 
hacker ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

First compromise the target machine and move to the privilege escalation phase, i have got access through SSH.

`sudo -l` command will list what are the command can be run without providing password.

To get Root access just type `sudo su` command or `sudo bash`

# Allow Root Privilege to Binary commands:
Some scenarios user has the authentication to execute any file or command of particular directory like /etc/find , /etc/cp etc.

```shell
hacker ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
```
Note: NOPASSWD that means for executing this command does’nt need password.
# Spawn Root Access using Find Command:
Again the compromise the target machine and move to privilege escalation phase, enter the command`sudo -l.`
